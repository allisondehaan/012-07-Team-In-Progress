- Since the last meeting (4/3) we have...

allisondehaan:
Updated the format for the login page
Created a function logout page that logs out the user + authentication middleware
Worked on branch for the functional routing on the website to the logout page and home page
I created a similar look as login page and added a link so users could return to the login page (other than using nav bar)
