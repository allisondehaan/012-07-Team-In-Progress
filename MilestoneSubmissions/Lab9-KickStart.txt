Application Name: Work In Progress

Application Description: Our project, "Work-in-Progress," entails the development of a Google Chrome extension aimed at enhancing productivity and collaboration for users managing their tasks and reminders. This extension allows individuals to keep track of their tasks and general reminders conveniently within their browser. With "Work-in-Progress," users can efficiently create, organize, and monitor their to-do lists, ensuring they remain focused and on schedule with their TO-DOs.
A standout feature of "Work-in-Progress" is its integration of collaboration capabilities. Users have the ability to share their existing TO-DOs with others on the platform, promoting teamwork and coordination. If the recipient doesn't have an account, the extension will trigger an email prompt, encouraging them to join the platform in order to view the sent message. This collaborative functionality enables users to delegate tasks and achieve collective objectives more effectively.  Furthermore, "Work-in-Progress" boasts an intuitive interface designed to blend with the Chrome experience. This ensures that users have quick and easy access to their TO-DO lists, allowing them to stay organized and focused on their work. Whether it's managing personal tasks or coordinating team projects, "Work-in-Progress" empowers users to optimize their productivity and progress towards their goals efficiently.

Vision Statement: For students, who need help organizing daily tasks. The “Work In Progress” is a Google Chrome extension that allows users to manage their TO-DOs in one place. Unlike Notepad, our product allows users to also send notes to others within the program in a quick and easy way.

Development Methodology: For the scheduled four week project we will be using Trello to track our progress. We will utilize 3 sections, being To-Do, In Progress, and Complete, to track where we are in producing the features we decide to have. We can assign member names and due dates to each item under these sections allowing us to be clear both when they are due, and who has and is working on them.

Communication Plan: Our team plans to use Discord to communicate with each other throughout the project. 

Meeting Plan: Our weekly meeting with our TA is on Tuesdays from 6-7 pm. For our team meetings, it’ll be on Monday at 7pm over a Discord call.
